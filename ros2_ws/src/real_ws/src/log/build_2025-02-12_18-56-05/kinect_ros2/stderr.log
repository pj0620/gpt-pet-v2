CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 3.10 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value.  Or, use the <min>...<max> syntax
  to tell CMake that the project requires at least <min> but has been updated
  to work with policies introduced by <max> or earlier.


CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:36 (find_package):
  By not providing "Finddepth_image_proc.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "depth_image_proc", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "depth_image_proc"
  with any of the following names:

    depth_image_procConfig.cmake
    depth_image_proc-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "depth_image_proc" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "depth_image_proc_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "depth_image_proc" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
